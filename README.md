# LJ-cluster
Here is my C/C++ code for the project named "boundary LJ-cluster"
Actually, I realized at Both Matlab and Mathematica. However, the C/C++ code is the most efficient one
I have to vesion for C/C++ code:
- the fisrt one is pure C code
- the next one is the C/C++ code.

the difference is that in the first code, i just write my own Linear algebra,  and for the C++ part, I just use an exsited code library named  [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/). So it needs to setup before you run the code.

More detail information about algorithm and others, please see [blog article](veya-ztn.xyz)
